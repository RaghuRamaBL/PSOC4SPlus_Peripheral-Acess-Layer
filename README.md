🚀 PSoC4SPlus Peripheral Access Layer

📦 A lightweight, baseline HAL for PSoC™ 4S+ series microcontrollers

Welcome to the PSoC4SPlus Peripheral Access Layer repository — a foundational hardware abstraction layer designed to make working with the PSoC™ 4S+ microcontroller series easier, cleaner, and more intuitive.

This project was born out of hands-on learning during an Embedded Systems cohort and hackathon, where I gained real insight into how microcontroller hardware blocks interact with software. Using the device’s Technical Reference Manual (TRM), I’ve mapped key peripherals such as:

IRQ – Interrupt Controller

GPIO – Digital Input/Output

TCPWM – Timer / Counter / PWM

PERICLK – Peripheral Clock Controls

ADC – Analog-to-Digital Converter

🎯 Project Goal

The goal is to provide a clear and practical starting point for embedded developers working with PSoC™ 4S+ devices — whether you’re:

📘 Learning embedded systems

🧪 Building prototypes

🏗️ Architecting larger systems

🔧 Project Status

Actively maintained

More peripherals will be added incrementally

Features will evolve based on real project needs

💡 Feel free to explore, use, extend, and contribute!
